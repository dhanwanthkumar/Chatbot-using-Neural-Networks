# Chatbot using Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the creation of a chatbot using neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is trained to understand user intents and respond accordingly.

## Features

- **Intent Recognition**: The chatbot understands user input and predicts the intent behind it.
- **Neural Network Model**: Utilizes a neural network model trained on user patterns to recognize intents.
- **Training Data**: Uses an intents JSON file to train the model and generate responses.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following external libraries and modules:

- nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit for NLP tasks.
- keras: A high-level neural networks API for model definition and training.
- tensorflow: The TensorFlow library, required for Keras operations.
- numpy: A numerical computing library for array operations.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script `chatgui.py` to start the GUI application.

```bash
pip install nltk keras tensorflow numpy
